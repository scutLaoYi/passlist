# passlist

## What is passlist  

This is my personal password list.  
All password can be generated by this public part and my private salt part, with some hash algorithm.  

## Why I need this

With this public repo,   
I can generate the password directly, without any other things help, everywhere.  

## Security

Since the real password is some "hash value",like "478d69070120f7fd70a99ff119136f70".    
they are different by each others.   
And difficult to break using brute force.    

## Others

It's useless for everyone in the world except me.  
So please, don't try to break through my account with passlist.

And thanks github for offering me the free space to store my data.

## My cloud data storage for password

* passlist on github
* 2fa tool with my cellphone
* 2fa recovery code on google drive (or my real wallet with a paper)
* rsa key pair on google drive

I suggest everyone can have the password system like this.   
It's safe because each password is different, and difficult to break using brute force.    
It's convenience since everything is on the cloud. You can access them with Internet everywhere.    
Sure, a little difficult for Chinese people behind the wall. ^_^    
The only one your should remember is just the "private part" of your password generating process.    

## Feedback

If you find something wrong about my password storage function, please contact me and let me know.  
Shank you~
